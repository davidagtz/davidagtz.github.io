summary: "A custom build graphing calculator based off of Electron, React, and Redux. This app is completely functional for 5 operations"

Being inspired from services like Desmos and Wolfram Alpha one day, I decided to make my own graphing calculator. This one was going to be slightly different than those other services in that I was going to make it a desktop application instead of a website.

In order to do that, I chose to use Electron because of my deep knowledge of JavaScript, HTML+CSS, and React. I also had a bit of knowledge of parsing expressions from when I made a programming language in my senior year of high school.

I have faced a lot of problems, and I will continue to try to implement more features, but here are some screenshots:
