I wanted to make a ML project. Why? Because Why not? This project is still in development, but I have learned so much at this point. I have always known what Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, etc. were but never to this extent. I decided to go head first into making a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).

### The Problem

I have always enjoyed art. As such, I wanted to make a GAN that produced art in the style of Van Gogh. Please note, this is not a style GAN, but rather a GAN that produces random art.

### The Method

The first step in any type of supervised learning is the data collection. This was surprisingly easy. I was able to gather artwork and their time periods with a program I made with Beautiful Soup. This neatly downloaded, sorted, and resized images so that I could feed them into the GAN.

The GAN is built with Tensorflow, Keras, and Python. I trained it on Google Cloud. I learned a lot about how to design NNs and what different aspects do. In fact, I made a whole [document](https://github.com/davidagtz/VincentVanGANs/blob/master/NOTES.md) where I took notes about new things that I have learned. I learned a lot about loss, gradients, and activation functions. So here are some results.

After a bit of tweaking, this is the first epoch:

This is very random, but after all it is not trained at all.

This is the 300th epoch:

As you can see, this has changed drastically, but only in color. It has acquired a palette very similar to the nature works of Van Gogh with random redness.
