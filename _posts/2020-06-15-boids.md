I have learned a lot of things watching [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) and [Smarter Every Day](https://www.youtube.com/user/destinws2) on YouTube. One of the things they both covered was the behavior of birds while flocking. They both mention this [website](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) here that talks about three aspects of flocking behavior: separation, alignment, and cohesion. I became so interested that I wanted to implement it myself.

While implementing, I wanted to optimize the algorithm to find boid neighbors. Upon further research, I found that I could use a quadtree in order to get neightbors really quick. So I implemented boundary classes and a quadtree class.
